## Description:
A hand solitaire simulation program written in C++. To run just compile handSolitaire.cpp. There is MaxHeight 
functionality that allows you to choose how high you want the stack of cards to get during a game. To access MaxHeight 
just uncomment the code.

The output of the program is the deck of cards in order that yielded the result displayed. You can choose at the 
beginning wether you want a winning or random deck. The winning choice will just keep on simulating the game until it 
wins (brute force).
